The initial crystal quality check phase (link) is not enough to satisfactorily pass a crystal for use. As such, we
need to work to improve the process. Since we've checked random atomic lines/rows, perhaps it would be best to
perform check random checks on slices of the crystal. This crystal type contains two atoms composing the elements
"X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a well grown crystal, these atoms should alternate down each row and column.

You are given a slice of crystal lattice as a grid (2D array) of atoms "X" and "Z". The well grown grid should have
proper periodic arrangements both horizontally and vertically. If one atom is found next to another atom of its
element, the crystal is unusable. For example:

```
[["X", "Z"],
 ["Z", "X"]] is good

[["X", "Z", "X"],
 ["Z", "X", "Z"],
 ["X", "Z", "X"]] is good

[["X", "Z", "X"],
 ["Z", "Z", "Z"],
 ["X", "Z", "X"]] is bad
```
